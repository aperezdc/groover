# Groover

Groover is a simple remote for the [Groove Basin](http://groovebasin.com)
music player daemon. It uses GTK+ and WebKitGTK+ to provide a window where
Groove Basin's standard web interface is loaded â€” honestly I do not see the
whole point of re-creating the UI from scratch, so the idea is to keep
Groover simple, and focus on desktop integration instead.
